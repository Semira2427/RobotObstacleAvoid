<h1> <strong> Building a Line-Following with Obstacle Avoidance </strong> </h1>

<h2> Objective </h2>

<p> Using basic sensors (such as infrared for line detection and ultrasonic for obstacle avoidance), our group will construct a tiny robot that follows a line on the ground and avoids obstacles. The project focuses on the fundamentals of autonomous navigation, control algorithms, and sensor integration. </p>
